          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h5>Poverty vs Health Risks</h5>
          <p>People living in states with a higher poverty rate have higher health risks. The higher the poverty rate in the 
            state, the more likely people in the state will not have healthcare, more people in the state smoke and the obesity 
            rate is also higher. The outlier is Texas where the poverty rate is about average but there is a high percentage of 
            people in Texas who do not have healtcare.</p>

          <h5>Age vs Health Risks</h5>
          <p>There is a positive correlation between Age and the percentage of people who smoke. States with younger people 
            have a lower percentage of smokers compared to states with older folks. Utah has the youngest median age and the 
            lowest percentage of people who smoke. Tbe state also has a lower obesity rate in comparison to the rest of the 
            states.</p>

          <h5>Household vs Health Risks</h5>
          <p>States with a lower median household income have more health risks. The percentage of obese people and smokers 
            are much higher in states with lower income. This is not surprising given that the percentage of people with healtcare 
            is also lower in those states.</p>
