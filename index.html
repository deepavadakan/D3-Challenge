                <h5>Poverty vs Health Risks</h5>
                <p>People living in states with a higher poverty rate have higher health risks. States with a relatively higher 
                  poverty rate have more uninsured. States with a higher poverty rate also have more people in the state who smoke 
                  and a higher obesity rate. This is not surprising given the lack of access to healthcare and probably healthy 
                  and cheap food options. The outlier is Texas where the poverty rate is about average but it has the highest 
                  percentage of uninsured.</p>

                <h5>Age vs Health Risks</h5>
                <p>The chart shows a slight positive correlation between Age and the percentage of people who smoke. States with 
                  a lower median age have a lower percentage of smokers compared to states with a higher median age. There also 
                  appears to be a cluster of higher obesity in the 36-40 age group. Utah has the youngest median age and the 
                  lowest percentage of people who smoke. The state also has a lower obesity rate in comparison to the rest of 
                  the states. The median age of a majority of the states lies in the 36 - 40 range.</p>

                <h5>Household Income vs Health Risks</h5>
                <p>States with a lower median household income have more health risks. The percentage of obese people and smokers 
                  is much higher in states with lower income. This is probably due to the fact that the percentage of people with 
                  healthcare is also lower in those states.</p>
